# AWS Cloud Security Docs (Cayman Theme)

This site is ready for GitHub Pages using the **Cayman** theme and includes Preventive, Detective, and Responsive sections on the landing page, plus project subpages with links to SAD/ADR docs.

## Quick Start
1. Create a repo named `aws-cloud-security-docs` (or any name).
2. Copy these files to the repo root.
3. In GitHub → **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - Source: Deploy from branch
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Visit: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Replace placeholder docs
Swap each project’s `SAD.md` and `ADR.md` with your real documents.
